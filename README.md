Discuss what you learned in this (a) COVID-19 web app project and (b) Web Development 1 Course/Subject. 
a.)I've learned that paying attention to the current situation is very vital, in which it might be helpful in creating webpages in the future. You must also adapt to the current situation in order to survive.
b.)I've learned in this course that every task that we do must be done with understanding and not for the sake of just passing it on time because I've passed quite some tasks without properly understanding the whole context of it in which it is very much wrong, and it will eventually haunt me in this coming subjects. I will try to cope up with the current topics and find time to review on the past lessons in the mean time.


What is something you need to improve on Web Development?
-That is certainly my problem solving part in which I need to strengthen more than the rest, I usually found certain problems very long to understand compare to my classmates. I've also have difficulties in javascript and also for the positioning for both html and css.
